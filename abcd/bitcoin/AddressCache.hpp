 * and should also generate new addresses based on the HD gap limit.
 * This class should also cache its contents on disk,
 * avoiding the need to re-check everything on each login.
 *
 * This will allow the `AddressDb` to be a simple metadata store,
 * with no need to handle Bitcoin-specific knowledge.
